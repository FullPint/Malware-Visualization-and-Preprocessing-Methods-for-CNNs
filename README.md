Repository for Malware Visualization and Preprocessing work by Dr. Rakesh Verma and Alec Davila


## Data Sets
---
Any data sets needed for this work should be placed in the data sets folder.

```
  /root/data-sets/
```
They will be ignored due to keeping the repository size as minimal as possible.

Data Sets used in evaluation:

- MalImg Dataset orignally used in "Malware Images: Visualization and Automatic Classificatio"n by Nataraj et al., [mentioned here](https://vision.ece.ucsb.edu/research/signal-processing-malware-analysis). The link is currently dead and as of August 15, 2019 this [link](https://sarvamblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/supervised-classification-with-k-fold.html) works.

- Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015): This is referenced in "Malware Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Kalash et. al.. The data set can be found from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data)

- UH-JPL INSuRE (Spring 2019) dataset. Need to update a way to acquire the dataset.
